**Learning Sessions and Scheduling**
 1. Session Booking System: A simple booking system allowing learners to schedule
 individual or recurring sessions based on mentor availability.
 2. Automated Session Reminders: Automated email or SMS reminders are sent to learners
 and mentors to reduce no-shows.
 3. Goal Setting and Achievement Tracking: Tools for learners to set skill goals and track
 milestones (e.g., "Complete Python basics by next month").
 4. Group Study Rooms: Virtual group study spaces where learners can study together or
 collaborate on similar skills with occasional mentor assistance
